# EZ-Doc
Creating web documents for a large codebase can be overwhelming. 
Even though there are many automated HTML report generator applications; 
it still may prove to be difficult to use them.  If the user (s) did not 
adhere to the specifications of their web document generator, they would 
have one of three options. The first option would require them to reformat 
their source code. If proved to be too difficult, they could search for 
an application that matches their documentation style. Lastly, the user 
may believe that the time wasted on option one and two would be better 
spent on creating the HTML report by hand. Therefore, an application to 
perform this task must be created. A program that is flexible enough to be
told what to look for and what to do with it. To accomplish this, it will 
consist of four main components: graphical user interface (GUI), 
file manager (FM), file translator (FT), and script interpreter (SI). 
The GUI will make it easier to perform the work needed to be done. FMs main 
task is navigating through the userâ€™s computer to find what to convert. 
Finally, FT and SI are designed to work together to process the document. 
EZ-Doc is meant to simplify the process in creating HTML reports, 
saving time and money.
